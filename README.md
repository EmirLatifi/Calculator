# Calculator

## Description
Welcome to my project, this is a simple calculator application. This calculator is a lightweight and user-friendly application designed to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It allows users to perform four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users can input numbers using either the keyboard or the mouse, making it convenient for various input preferences.

## Key Points

- The calculator supports whole numbers, decimal numbers, and negative numbers.
- Error handling: The calculator notifies users if they try to divide by zero or enter invalid entries, so it wipes the numbers off the screen
- The calculator offers a clear button to reset the entry and start a new calculation and a button C which deletes only one number or arithmetic operation:


## Requirements
The calculator application can run on any device or operating system that supports a web browser with JavaScript enabled. No additional software or plugins are required.
